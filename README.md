Snake game by turtle (The python standard library)
The snake game is a game which is quite easy to play. I made this game by using python programming language library (Turtle).The objective of this game is to feed an increasing length of a snake with food which are found at random positions. I made it for fun so I hope you enjoy it . 
The project file contains python scripts (SnakeGame.py). Talking about the gameplay, it’s a single-player game, where the player (Snake) has to eat all the green dots in order to grow longer. The PC controls of this game are also simple. You have to use the arrow keys to move the snake from left to right, up and down. The game score is shown at the top. The gameplay design is so simple that the user won’t find it difficult to use and understand
